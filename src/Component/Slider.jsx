     <p> I have stayed there for 10 days during my work visit to Balrampur and Bahraich, I am amazed to see this beautiful property at Shravasti. As a hotelier lived inso many properties across India but never stayed like this property. The lobby has a lot of positive vibes, you sitat work and don't wanna go back to the room at all.

Employees are very professional and take care of you like you are at their homes.

I love the food at Jeevan Restaurant which is huge and the biggest in area, the best part is you just order any breakfast, lunch, or dinner at any time and the chef will cook it for you deliciously.

I am glad to see the services the hotel provides, and the best part is a quick service.

I thank all the restaurant staff, Pradeep Saxena, Birendra (GM), Chef who cook for us delicious food.

Thank you all would stay again and recommend Hotel Platinum to all my friends and family.

Thanks! More</p>

     <p> Nice hotel, Bathroom are clean and bed are so comfortable. Perfect ambiance. Food are teasty and not much spicy spacially Thai and korian food. I never believe that this kindof food we can find in Uttar Pradesh but surprisingly we find in hotel platinum which is situated in very small city.</p>

     <p> This hotel is truly amazing hotel, If you are traveling Buddhist sector like Bodhagaya, Lumbini, Kushinagar or any other places like same can not find better hotel then this. Lobbyand restaurants are simply wow. Rooms are so spacious including all amenities. They have separate meditational area in lobby which is so impressive. Music with "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami" make more soulfully .
In one word that this hotel is amazed you.</p>

     <p>The hotel made me feel like I found an oasis in the middle of nowhere. The hotel is local but manage with standardize with hands on duty manager. The room is clean, all equipments are traveller friendly. The staffs are very helpful and clean. There are spaces for praying and meditation with well decorated. The food is also good. All after a long trip, What else do you need more in Sharvasti?</p>
